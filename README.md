# Prerequisites

This script require pika, sys, webbrowser, csv, time, and deque.

# How to run the code

In an evironment with the prerequisits installed run the code using the python bbqproducer.py command

At this point you can only see the sent message since the consumers are not yet built.

If you are not wanting to see all the temperatures, press Crtl + C to end the code.

I have included the code to open the RabbitMQ console.  However, I am not able to pull it up on my computer.  Since it is just an error screen to me I have shut off the feature.
